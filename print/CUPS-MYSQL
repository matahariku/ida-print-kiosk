The table "page_log" is created from the file /var/log/cups/page_log
It contains page log ***that have been successfully printed***

FROM "man cupsd-logs":

   PAGE LOG FILE FORMAT
       The page_log file lists each page or group of pages that are sent to a printer.  By default, each line contains the following
       information:

           printer user job-id date-time page-number num-copies job-billing
             job-originating-host-name job-name media sides

           printer user job-id date-time total num-impressions job-billing
             job-originating-host-name job-name media sides
       For example the entries for a two page job called "myjob" might look like:

           DeskJet root 1 [20/May/1999:19:21:05 +0000] 1 1 acme-123
             localhost myjob na_letter_8.5x11in one-sided
           DeskJet root 1 [20/May/1999:19:21:05 +0000] 2 1 acme-123
             localhost myjob na_letter_8.5x11in one-sided

           DeskJet root 1 [20/May/1999:19:21:06 +0000] total 2 acme-123
             localhost myjob na_letter_8.5x11in one-sided

       The PageLogFormat directive in the cupsd.conf(5) file can be used to change this information.
       The  printer  field contains the name of the printer that printed the page.  If you send a job to a printer class, this field
       will contain the name of the printer that was assigned the job.

       The user field contains the name of the user (the IPP requesting-user-name attribute) that submitted this file for printing.

       The job-id field contains the job number of the page being printed.

       The date-time field contains the date and time of when the page started printing.  The format of this field is  identical  to
       the data-time field in the access_log file.

       The  page-number and num-copies fields contain the page number and number of copies being printed of that page.  For printers
       that cannot produce copies on their own, the num-copies field will always be 1.

       Lines containing the keyword "total" have a num-impressions field instead which provides  the  total  number  of  impressions
       (sides) that have been printed on for the job.

       The  job-billing  field  contains  a copy of the job-billing or job-account-id attributes provided with the IPP Create-Job or
       Print-Job requests or "-" if neither was provided.

       The job-originating-host-name field contains the hostname or IP address of the client that printed the job.

       The job-name field contains a copy of the job-name attribute provided with the IPP Create-Job or Print-Job requests or "-" if
       none was provided.

       The  media field contains a copy of the media or media-col/media-size attribute provided with the IPP Create-Job or Print-Job
       requests or "-" if none was provided.

       The sides field contains a copy of the sides attribute provided with the IPP Create-Job or Print-Job requests or "-" if  none
       was provided.
